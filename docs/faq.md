# Frequently Asked Questions

## Could you add templating engine X?

There are a **lot** of templating languages: Jade, Swig, pure.js, Nunjucks, Underscore, Mustache etc. We don't believe there is a single right choice, it depends on the situation and desired complexity, so we chose not to have a built-in templating solution. However, we have [recipes](recipes) for implementing some of them, so you can use them as references.
